# Project Name

This repository contains the embedded software for the ECE senior design project at UT Austin. The software is built on top of Nordic Semiconductor's NRF Connect SDK.

## Installation / Setup

Before you clone the repository, it is important that you setup the necessary toolchains for an NRF based project.
To install the **necessary VSCODE extensions**, follow NRF's getting started guide [here](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/installation.html).

After you have done this, clone this repository, and navigate to the `NRF connect` extension in your sidebar.
This extension will have all of the tools you need to develop, flash, and debug the board.
